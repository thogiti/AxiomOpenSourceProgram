The approach in the [code](https://zkrepl.dev/?gist=973f372587fedaa48b4d992ddf875da2) involves iterating over the input data, counting the number of matches, and filtering the data based on the match condition. The filtered data is then assigned to the output signals. The code ensures that the output data has the same size as the input data and follows the specified filtering logic.

1. The code begins with the `pragma circom 2.1.4;` statement, which specifies the version of Circom being used.

2. The `Filter` template is defined, which takes input signals and produces output signals.

3. Input Signals:
    - `inputSignal` is a 2D array signal that represents the input data. It has a size of 100 rows and 2 columns.
    - `matchSignal` is a single input signal that represents the value to match against the first entry of each tuple in `inputSignal`.

4. Output Signals:
    - `numMatches` is an output signal that represents the number of elements in `inputSignal` whose first entry matches `matchSignal`.
    - `outputSignal` is a 2D array signal that represents the filtered output data. It has the same size as `inputSignal`.

5. Counting Matches:
    - The code initializes a variable `nMatches` to `0`, which will be used to count the number of matches.
    - A `for` loop is used to iterate over each element in `inputSignal`.
    - Inside the loop, an `if` statement checks if the first entry of the current tuple in `inputSignal` matches `matchSignal`.
    - If there is a match, the `nMatches` variable is incremented by `1`.

6. Filtering and Padding:
    - The code initializes a 2D array `outArray` to store the filtered output data.
    - Another for loop is used to iterate over each element in `inputSignal`.
    - Inside the loop, an `if` statement checks if the first entry of the current tuple in `inputSignal` matches `matchSignal`.
    - If there is a match, the corresponding tuple in `outArray` is updated to have the same first entry and a second entry of `0`.
    - If there is no match, the corresponding tuple in `outArray` is updated to have both entries as `0`.

7. Assigning Output:
    - The code assigns the value of `nMatches` to the `numMatches` output signal.
    - The code assigns the value of `outArray` to the `outputSignal` output signal.

8. The code ends with the closing of the `Filter` template.
